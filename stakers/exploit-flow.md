# Exploit Flow

There are three important stages of an exploit:

1. The rumor of the exploit
2. When the claim gets filed
3. When the exploit gets paid out

Only stakers who are still locked up during the third phase will have to pay out. Any staker who unstakes funds before the actual payout (because they are in an unstaking window) will not have to pay out the exploit.&#x20;

Each covered protocol will have a policy that is targeted to be 33% or less of the total Sherlock staking pool. This ensures that any single exploit event an any single protocol can cause a payout for a maximum of 33% of the staking pool. More than 33% of the staking pool can be used for a payout if a single event affects multiple covered protocols or if a single protocol is hacked multiple times (in verifiably independent events).&#x20;

However, if the size of the exploit (specifically the funds lost) is smaller than the total coverage amount at a protocol, the size of the payout will be a fraction of the 33% maximum.&#x20;
