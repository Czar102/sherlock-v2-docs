# Pricing

Pricing is determined in the Audit Requirements Checklist, and mostly based on the size and complexity of the codebase.

## Coverage Pricing

Normally, the first 3 months of coverage should be paid for at the conclusion of the audit (at the same time as the second 50% of the audit cost).

The rest of the coverage payment should be added once the first payment is nearing exhaustion.

A protocol team can decide to manage payment directly using the [protocol portal](https://app.sherlock.xyz/protocols/balance) or can simply send payments to Sherlock's multi-sig.
