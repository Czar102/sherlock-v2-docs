# Getting Started

Sherlock offers coverage for protocols that have gone through our auditing process, in order to maintain a high bar for security. The process to complete an audit and get coverage live can be found [here](../audits/protocols/how-it-works-for-protocols.md).&#x20;

Once a protocol has completed its fix-review, it has the ability to initiate coverage on the contracts which were audited whenever it chooses, provided no material changes have been made to those contracts.

A protocol can request an audit [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqy21chyyzhAfbCxMQOlNTlYxegfvxZDhYsPkpI\_xD6AQiag/viewform)!
