## Strategy distribution

> For more info see [github docs](https://github.com/sherlock-protocol/sherlock-v2-core/blob/main/STRATEGY.md "Sherlock strategy github documentation") 

The goal of this contract architecture is to distribute USDC between different yield strategies in a transparent and configurable way.

There are currently 5 strategies implemented to work with our strategy distribution

- Aave
- Compound
- Euler
- Maple
- TrueFi

At the moment only Aave, Compound and Euler are deployed, the configuration of the current deployment is illustrated in the image below.

See [Deployed Contracts](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/developer/deployed-contracts) for the contract addresses related to the strategy deployment.
