# Judging Tutorials

Here is a simple tutorial for taking part in a judging contest effectively. Please note that these are merely pointers for beginners and not mandatory steps. You can always follow your own steps to judging a contest.

Here are the steps that I follow when judging a contest

### Phase 1: Understand the protocol docs and protocol README

Understanding the README is a must before you start with the contest. Ideally, as a judge, you have either taken part in the audit contest or must have a decent understanding of the protocol functioning. Remember, before you start a contest you must have read the following:

1. Contest README: This provides necessary context from the contest's perspective.
2. Protocol README/DOCS: These help with understanding the fundamentals of a protocol.&#x20;

Please watch the video below where I do a quick walkthrough of filtering out some of the low/invalid issues.&#x20;

### Phase 3: Duplication

In the next video let us look at issue duplication. However in future contests, you will be provided with the AI de-duplicated issues, it may not be 100% accurate and you still need to make sure the duplication is valid. This video might help with the process.
