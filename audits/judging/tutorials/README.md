An important message before starting with Sherlock contests
{% endembed %}

To participate effectively in Sherlock contests, you need to consider two important factors:

1. **Understand Sherlock's Core Principle:** Sherlock's approach to security auditing is unique. It focuses on aligning strong incentives with the expertise of top security professionals. Unlike relying solely on reputation, Sherlock backs its audits with significant financial stakes, motivating Watsons to deliver high-quality work. Understanding this principle helps Watsons better grasp Sherlock's rules and the reasoning behind them.
2. **Familiarize Yourself with Sherlock's Judging Rules:** It's crucial to have a thorough understanding of Sherlock's judging rules, which determine how issues are evaluated. You can find detailed guidance on issue criteria here: [Sherlock Issue Criteria Guide](https://docs.sherlock.xyz/audits/watsons/judging). Take the time to review these instructions carefully.

Many of the top-performing Watsons excel because they have a solid grasp of these factors and often contribute to improving the rules as smart contract technology evolves.

Make sure to check the guide regularly because it gets updated often. Also, it's a good idea to review audit reports from the last 5 to 10 contests. This can be really helpful in staying up-to-date and improving your skills.
