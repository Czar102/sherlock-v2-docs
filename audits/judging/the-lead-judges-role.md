# The Lead Judge's Role

#### Phase 1:

* The Lead Judge takes part in the judging contest.
* At the end of the contest, the Lead Judge's final judging repository will be synced to the original contest judging repository to generate the issues.

#### Phase 2:

* The initial list of issues will then be shared with the protocol team to add comments and relevant labels.
* The Lead Judge shall coordinate with the protocol team, Lead Senior Watson & Sherlock to resolve the issues based on the comments/labels. You can also add comments on the issues to help with the process.

#### Phase 3:

* Initial results will be generated & announced based on the final issue state from Phase 2. Completion of this step opens up the Escalation period.
* Once the Escalation period ends, Sherlock's internal judges will review the escalations and discuss with Lead Judge/Watson, and the team to resolve the escalations.
* Final results are announced.

The ideal timeline to complete all 3 phases is two weeks from the end of the contest.

#### The Best Lead Judge

* Understands Sherlock's Judging guidelines.
* Understands the codebase well from the contest.
* Communicates effectively with all the parties involved.
* Adds relevant comments, if required, on valid/invalid issues to make the process easier for everyone involved.
* Lead Judges effectively result in ideally zero valid escalations.
* Leads the judging process to completion before the two-week deadline.
