# Protocol Involvement During the Audit Process

At the beginning of the audit, the protocol team will be added to a Discord channel with all auditors competing. This is designed to facilitate any Q\&A between the auditors and protocol team as they try to better understand the system. Protocol teams are not mandated to engage with the auditor Q\&A / discussion, however, we have historically found this type of dialogue to improve the quality & outcomes of the audit and is encouraged.&#x20;

Throughout the contest, auditors will submit issues into a private GitHub, allowing the protocol to begin reviewing issues in real-time. Our intention is to allow protocols to have full transparency into the type of issues that are being found, and begin planning earlier in the process if a subsequent review will be needed before going to mainnet.
