# Audit Pricing and Timeline

Each audit consists of a fixed pay element to properly compensate and incentivize dedicated senior auditors, as well as a prize pool for all contestants to compete to win. In order to properly align incentives with protocols, Sherlock underwrites each audit with up to $10M in smart contract coverage, which can be activated at any point after the audit is completed, provided there havenâ€™t been subsequent changes to the code base. As a result, Sherlock has developed the following broad underwriting guidelines for how much time is needed to complete an audit of codebases of various sizes in order to comfortably write coverage behind the audit in the future.



| **Solidity Lines (nSLOC)** | <500     | \~1000   | \~1500 - 3000 | \~3500 - 5000 | >5000     |
| -------------------------- | -------- | -------- | ------------- | ------------- | --------- |
| **Pricing**                | \~$15k   | \~$38k   | \~75k         | \~$113k       | \~$150k+  |
| **Audit Timeline**         | \~3 days | \~7 days | \~14 days     | \~21 days     | \~28 days |

> Note: Sherlock utilizes the tool [Solidity Metrics](https://github.com/ConsenSys/solidity-metrics) to calculate nSLOC.
