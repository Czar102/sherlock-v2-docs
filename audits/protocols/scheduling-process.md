# Scheduling Process

Sherlock aims to provide one of the most flexible audit solutions in the space, starting with a simplified scheduling process. Once an initial assessment has been completed and a preliminary quote provided, the next steps include:&#x20;

1. Protocol puts down a deposit for 25% of the audit cost and indicates which date it would like the audit to begin - can be scheduled with at least 3 days' notice.&#x20;
2. Sherlock will then either:&#x20;
   * Confirm the senior auditor and start date within 72 hours, or&#x20;
   * Suggest an alternative start date, or&#x20;
   * Request the protocol team select an alternative start date&#x20;

> Note: In the unlikely instance where Sherlock does not confirm the originally proposed start date, the protocol has the option to withdraw the full amount of their deposit.&#x20;

Of course, the farther out a protocol schedules an audit, the higher the likelihood they generate maximum Watson participation and secure the highest-ranked senior Watson.
