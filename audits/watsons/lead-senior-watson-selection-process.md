# Lead Senior Watson Selection Process

Watsons who outperform their peers and are ranked in the top 10% of the Sherlock ecosystem are promoted to Senior Watsons. These Senior Watsons have the opportunity to signal their interest in being selected as the Senior Watson in an upcoming audit contest. Senior Watsons will be included in a specific Discord channel where new audit opportunities will be posted. The Sherlock team will also DM all Senior Watsons to check out the Senior Watson channel in Discord anytime a new audit contest is posted.

Seniors Watsons have two options if they seek to be selected:

1. Indicate interest in being the Lead Senior Watson for the protocol and dates posted.
2. Indicate interest in being the senior Watson, but propose alternative dates when youâ€™re available.

After 72 hours, Sherlock will select and notify the highest ranked Senior Watson as the Lead Senior Watson for the audit. Unselected Senior Watsons can still compete for the prize pool. If the Senior Watson does not confirm their participation in those 72 hours, Sherlock will select and notify the next highest ranked Senior Watson (who indicated interest) to the Lead Senior Watson position.

If the audit was scheduled >72 hours in advance of the start date, then Sherlock will also contact the Senior Watson to re-confirm availability. We understand that life can sometimes get in the way of prior commitments, so Sherlock will reconfirm your participation to give us enough time to find an alternate Senior Watson to lead the audit contest if needed.
