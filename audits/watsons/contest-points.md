# Contest Points

Sherlock has a cold-start problem. Because there are no rankings initially, Sherlock doesn’t know who the Senior Watsons should be. To fix this, Sherlock has whitelisted a select group of security experts to be Senior Watsons. This whitelist will be based on security experts who have led audits for Sherlock in the past. Rankings will show up on the leaderboard after each Watson’s first contest. However, promotion to the Senior Watson role or demotion from the Senior Watson role will only happen once a Watson has completed two contests.&#x20;

> Note: Watsons have the ability to decide if they want a contest to count towards their ranking. The only catch is that you must indicate this (there’s a button on the sign-up page) before the contest ends. This is to ensure that a Watson who is busy or not able to dedicate enough time to a contest doesn’t get penalized in the rankings. However, if you’re the Lead Senior Watson chosen for the contest (receiving fixed pay), the contest will always count towards your ranking.&#x20;

The amount of Contest Points available to gain in each contest (to move up the ranks) is determined by the average scores of the competing Watsons, based on previous Sherlock contests:&#x20;

Let’s assume Bob’s average score is 7, Joe’s average score is 13, and Mike’s average score is 5. And only Bob, Joe, and Mike compete in a contest. The total Contest Points available in that contest will be 25 (7+13+5).&#x20;

All Watsons who sign up with a wallet address that has been used in Code Arena will get a temporary score based on their top 5 best performances in Code Arena contests (backtested using Sherlock’s scoring system). This will determine how many Contest Points a “new” Watson brings with them into a Sherlock contest:&#x20;

Let’s assume Bob had never competed in a Sherlock contest before. His Contest Points would be calculated using his temporary score (the average of his 5 best Code Arena performances). Bob receives no benefit from his temporary score except that they will add to the total pool of Contest Points available in the first contest he competes in.&#x20;

If a Watson signs up with an address that has never participated in Code Arena, their temporary score will be the median of all Code Arena and Sherlock scores in our database.&#x20;

Your temporary score will not show up in the Sherlock rankings and it will be replaced as soon as you get your first score from a Sherlock competition. The Sherlock rankings will only be based on scores earned from Sherlock competitions.&#x20;

Once a Watson has competed in a Sherlock competition, their ranking will be determined by the average points scored in their 5 most recent Sherlock competitions. It drops off after 5 competitions so that “bad” scores do not stay with you forever.
