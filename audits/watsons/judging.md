# Judging

At the official end-date of the audit, Sherlockâ€™s team will go through and de-duplicate issues, as well as judge every issue. Sherlock is exclusively focused on high and medium severity findings, as these are the types of vulnerabilities which will cause a loss of user funds and most materially damage the reputation of the protocols Sherlock seeks to protect.

**Criteria for Issues:**&#x20;

**Medium:** There is a viable scenario (even if unlikely) that could cause the protocol to enter a state where a material amount of funds can be lost. The attack path is possible with assumptions that either mimic on-chain conditions or reflect conditions that have a reasonable chance of becoming true in the future. The vulnerability must be something that is not considered an acceptable risk by a reasonable protocol team.&#x20;

**High:** This vulnerability would result in a material loss of funds and can be executed profitably. The attack path is possible with reasonable assumptions that mimic on-chain conditions. The vulnerability must be something that is not considered an acceptable risk by a reasonable protocol team.

### **Case Law**

\
**Could Denial-of-Service (DOS), griefing, or locking of contracts count as a Medium (or High) issue?**

It would not count if the DOS, etc. lasts a known, finite amount of time. If it will result in funds being indefinitely (or potentially indefinitely) inaccessible, then it would count as a loss of funds and be eligible for a Medium or High designation.&#x20;
